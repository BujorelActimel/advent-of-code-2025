# Advent of Code 2025

This is the repository with all my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/).
The solutions will be written in kotlin and zig (probably in this order) with kind of an automatic
setup for building and running specific solution based on language, day and part. You can look into the aoc script.

## Fork setup

The setup is also separated in the `setup` branch if you want to fork it and also use it, although
it's kind of improbable that you will want to solve AOC in kotlin and zig, like what are the odds,
but you can still do it. Maybe you only want one of the languages or adapt it to whatever language/s you prefer.

## AOC script usage

```bash
./aoc kot 01 1    # Run Kotlin solution for day 1 part 1
./aoc zig 05 2    # Run Zig solution for day 5 part 2
```
